# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I became more testing during code writing, and more iteration made my code development more efficient

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I should communicate more with my friends about the problems and experiences I encounter in programming every week. You should start your weekly programming practice immediately after each week's class. "Strike while the iron is hot."

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Every week, I spend 1 to 3 hours on programming exercises, studying sentences that are not yet clear, such as how to use certain built-in functions

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Should not start a programming exercise at the very last minute of each exercise submission

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Nothing, the teachers were great
