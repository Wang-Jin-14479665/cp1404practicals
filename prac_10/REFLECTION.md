# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Initially, the accuracy of my estimates varied widely. I often underestimate how long tasks will take, especially those that involve new concepts or complex coding challenges.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more familiar with the typical challenges and time requirements of each task, and my estimation skills improved. I started benchmarking from previous tasks and allowing buffer time for unexpected problems.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I recognize the importance of considering all phases of the development process, including planning, coding, debugging, and testing. Estimating has also taught me to be more realistic and flexible in my time management.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

After receiving feedback from others, I found areas in the code that could be improved, such as readability and efficiency. This also highlights the importance of clear documentation and adherence to coding standards.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing other people's code, I learned about different coding styles and solutions. It helped me develop a critical eye for spotting potential errors and inefficiencies, and reinforced best practices.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I will introduce more real-world scenarios into practical tasks to provide a better environment for applying coding skills. In addition, adding more peer-review sessions can enhance collaborative learning.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I'm good at problem solving and always write clean, efficient code. I proactively seek feedback and implement suggestions to improve my work. In addition, I manage my time effectively, complete tasks on time and complete them thoroughly.
