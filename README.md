### Three main lessons about "clean code" 

**Readability:**
Clean code should be easy to read and understand for other developers (or your future self). This means using meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and clear comments where necessary.

**Simplicity:** 
Keep your code as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive to write concise and straightforward code. This often involves breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones and adhering to the principle of single responsibility.

**Maintainability:** 
Write code that is easy to modify and extend. This includes following best practices such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), using modular design, and writing tests to ensure your code functions as expected and to facilitate future changes.
